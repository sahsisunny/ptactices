# Node JS Tutorial

## WHat is Node JS?

- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows developers to create server-side applications using JavaScript, which can be run on a wide variety of operating systems.

- Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine that powers the Google Chrome web browser. This allows Node.js to execute JavaScript code at high speeds, making it well-suited for building high-performance, scalable applications.

- Node.js is commonly used for building server-side APIs and web services, real-time applications (such as chat and gaming apps), and microservices-based architectures. It is also often used in conjunction with other frameworks and libraries, such as Express.js, to simplify the development of web applications.
