# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Class Component

- Class component is a component that is defined as a class extending React.Component or React.PureComponent.
- Class component has a render method.
- Class component has its own state.
- Class component has its own lifecycle methods.
- Class component can have state and lifecycle hooks.
- Class component can have refs.
- Class component can use shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle hook to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Class component can use forceUpdate lifecycle hook to force a re-render.
- Class component can use static getDerivedStateFromProps lifecycle hook to update state as the result of changes in props over time.
- Class component can use getSnapshotBeforeUpdate lifecycle hook to capture a value from the DOM before it is changed.
- Class component can use componentDidCatch lifecycle hook to catch errors in any child components and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

## Class Component Example

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";

class ClassComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Class Component</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ClassComponent;
```

## When to use Class Component

- When you need to use lifecycle hooks.
- When you need to use refs.
- When you need to use state.
- When you need to use shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle hook to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- When you need to use forceUpdate lifecycle hook to force a re-render.

#### Class Component is also known as Stateful Component.
