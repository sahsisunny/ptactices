               <p class="about">
                    Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a family of grocers in Vadnagar, a town in
                    Gujarat. His father, Damodardas Mulchand Modi, was a Chimanbhai Patel, a grocer and a local leader
                    of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). His mother, Hiraben, was a housewife. Modi has two
                    younger brothers, one of whom, Prahlad, died in infancy. Modi was introduced to the RSS at the age
                    of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. He left home at the age of 17 to live
                    in an RSS hostel near the university campus and later became a pracharak (full-time worker) for the
                    RSS. He returned to Vadnagar to marry Jashodaben Chimanlal in 1967, and they had two daughters.
               
                    Narendra Damodar Das Modi (born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician serving as the 14th and
                    current prime minister of India since 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014
                    and is the Member of Parliament from Varanasi. He is a member of the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and
                    of the Rastriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer
                    organization. He is the longest serving prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress.
                    Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary
                    education. He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has discussed having to work as a child in
                    his father's tea stall in the Vadnagar railway station, which has not been reliably corroborated. At
                    age 18, Modi was married to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he abandoned soon after. He first
                    publicly acknowledged her as his wife more than four decades later when required to do so by Indian
                    law, but has made no contact with her since. Modi has asserted he had travelled in northern India
                    for two years after leaving his parental home, visiting a number of religious centers, but few
                    details of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time
                    worker for the RSS. After the state of emergency was declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in
                    1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions
                    within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.
