# Web basics
## What is a web page?
A web page is a document that is written in HTML and is displayed in a web browser. It can contain text, images, videos, games, or any other content. Web pages are usually accessed via the Internet, through a web browser.
## What is a web browser?
A web browser is a software application for retrieving, presenting, and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) and may be a web page, image, video, or other piece of content. Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources.
## What is a web server?
A web server is a computer system that processes requests via HTTP, the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the World Wide Web. The term can refer to the entire system, or specifically to the software that accepts and supervises the HTTP requests.
## What is a web site?
A web site is a collection of related web pages, including multimedia content, typically identified with a common domain name, and published on at least one web server. Notable examples are wikipedia.org, google.com, and amazon.com.
## What is a web application?
A web application or web app is a clientâ€“server software application in which the client (including the user interface and client-side logic) runs in a web browser. Common web applications include webmail, online retail sales, online auctions, wikis, instant messaging services and many other functions.
## What is a web service?
A web service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. It has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically WSDL). Other systems interact with the web service in a manner prescribed by its description using SOAP-messages, typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML serialization in conjunction with other web-related standards.


# Concept of Internet
## What is the Internet?
The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents of the World Wide Web (WWW) and the infrastructure to support email.
## What is the World Wide Web?
The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. With a web browser, one can view web pages that may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia and navigate between them via hyperlinks. Hyperlinking between web pages conveys to the reader the site structure and guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page containing a directory of the site web pages.

# History of Internet
## What is the history of the Internet?
The history of the Internet begins with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s. Initial concepts of wide area networking originated in several computer science laboratories in the United States, United Kingdom, and France. The U.S. Department of Defense awarded contracts as early as the 1960s for packet switching network technology research. The first wide area packet switched network an experimental network called the ARPANET was funded by DARPA and deployed in 1969. It was shut down in 1990. The first two hosts were UCLA and the Stanford Research Institute. The first four hosts were connected to the ARPANET by 1971. The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990. The NSFNET was established in 1986, connecting a small number of commercial and academic sites around the country. It was replaced in 1995 by the commercial Internet. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking. Online shopping has grown exponentially both for major retailers and small businesses and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their "brick and mortar" presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online. Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries. The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. The term "Internet" is often used to refer specifically to the high-profile infrastructure of interconnected networks known as the "Internet backbone" that carries most of the information that makes up the global Internet. This infrastructure is owned and operated by a number of private companies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents of the World Wide Web (WWW) and the infrastructure to support email. The origins of the Internet reach back to research commissioned by the United States federal government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication with computer networks. The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s. The funding of the National Science Foundation Network in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many diverse networks. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging, Internet forums,


# Advantage of Internet
- It is a global network of networks.
- It is a network of computers that are connected to each other through telephone lines, cables, and satellites to share information and resources such as software and hardware.
- It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.
